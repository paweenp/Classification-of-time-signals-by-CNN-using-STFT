Dear all,

Sorry for the delay. I forgot to write the record of our discussion on yesterday.

Questions.

1.How did the learning process work? --> Feed Object 1 all images then Object 2 all images and so on.

2.Can we use MATLAB for our Project, If so it could help simplify our CNN methods? --> We will discuss with Professor.

Notes

1.Everyone can start push everything they found to own branch

2.Migrating project to Python

   For Paween and Mukit --> Responsible from Feeding Spectrograms to Object Classification.
    Expected Input: Spectrogram Images from each Objects.

3. Next meeting will be on 9th Aug Monday at 4 PM. ( can change the time, since this is not normal meeting from every week)
