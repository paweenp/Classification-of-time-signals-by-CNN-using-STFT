Dear all,

Project group T3: Classification of time signals by CNN using STFT

Today I had a short meeting with Prof.Pech and asked some questions to clarify our doubts.

I asked him to clarify the signal source.

Prof. explained the signal source as the source of audio signal or the secondary source which is the surface reflects the signal.

By using the classification, we should be able to see whether each frequency indicates the source as the original one or the reflected one.

Also, if there is any existed model, we can improve it as well.

In the mean time, prof. will send us the 1-D dataset we will use for the project.

PS. Prof. Pech has not uploaded the lecture slides yet.

Best regards
