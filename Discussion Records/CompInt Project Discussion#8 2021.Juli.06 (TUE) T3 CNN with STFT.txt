Dear all,

Questions

1.  biased Dataset?

Answers

1.  Tasks --> we can choose between 1. Distinguish Object1 from others or 2. Distinguish each Object (1 - 3)

2.  There is a method to balance dataset but in this dataset there is no difference.

3.  Training Data should be selected Randomly (Different each time)


Today we have verified our experiment design with Professor and it seems correct.

The Size of spectrogram images were downsampled to 1/10 of their original size.

Since the ConvNets we used is the one from MATLAB, we have to research more on its Layer and Configurations (Variables)

We will try to migrate into Python from MATLAB from now on.

Ps. In this E-Mail, you will also find Experiment Design excel file as attached file.

Best regards
