Dear all,

This is what I got from our discussion with professor.

(MON)

QUESTIONS
1.  Explain Input Signal
2.  Clarify our goals of project

ANSWERS
1. Can Skip row in data up to F
1. Y-Axis is the amplitude
2. X-Axis is the time
3. The goal of the project : identify the secondary source ( from object)
from thew freqeucny signal.
4. Data in each spreadsheet is for each object and is for the secondary source ( from object)
5. Frequency Domain, Normalized the frequency before input to the CNN
6. STFT --> Normalized --> CNN
7. Total energy should be one or something ( we have to identify it )
8. We can start with total energy = 1 (preferrable)
9. After normalized data --> feed the data to the CNN
10. STFT --> Spectogram --> write into a picture and feed to CNN
11. Find out the length of STFT window 128 or 256 or else?
12. Base on CNN, we have to test with 1-D or 2-D (Preprocessing)
13.

FOCUS
Initially Focusing on : Spectogram


Prof. will keep feeding the data from other objects to us.
